    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Simple Carbonara (4 Servings)</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>3 Tbsp. kosher salt, plus more</li>
        <li>4 oz. guanciale (salt-cured pork jowl), pancetta (Italian bacon), or bacon</li>
        <li>2 oz. Parmesan</li>
        <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 lb. spaghetti, bucatini, or rigatoni</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>

    <h3>Simple Carbonara</h3>

    <ol>
    <li>Heat 6 qt. water in a large pot over high. When water starts to steam, add 3 Tbsp. salt and cover pot with a lid (this will bring water to a boil faster).</li>

    <li>While you are waiting on the water, do a little prep. Remove 4 oz. guanciale from packaging and cut into about 1x¼" strips. Finely grate 2 oz. cheese and set aside one-quarter of cheese for later.</li>

    <li>Whisk 4 egg yolks and 2 whole eggs in a medium bowl until no streaks remain, then stir in remaining grated cheese. Add several cranks of pepper and set aside.</li>

    <li>Working next to pot, heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Add guanciale and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp around the edges, 7–10 minutes.</li>

    <li>Remove pot from heat. Using a wooden spoon, fish out guanciale and transfer to a small bowl. Pour fat into a heatproof measuring cup, then add back about 3 Tbsp. to pot. Discard any remaining fat.</li>

    <li>Cook 1 lb. pasta in boiling water, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes shy of package instructions. Just before pasta is finished, scoop out 1¾ cups pasta cooking liquid with same heatproof measuring cup.</li>

    <li>Add 1 cup reserved pasta cooking liquid to Dutch oven and bring to a boil over medium-high. Drain pasta in a colander, then transfer to Dutch oven.</li>

    <li>Cook pasta, stirring constantly and vigorously, until al dente and water is reduced by about half, about 2 minutes. Remove pot from heat.</li>

    <li>Whisk ¼ cup pasta cooking liquid into reserved egg mixture, then very slowly stream into Dutch oven, stirring constantly, until cheese is melted and egg is thickened to form a glossy sauce. Season with salt, if needed. Thin sauce with remaining ½ cup pasta cooking liquid, adding a tablespoonful at a time, until it's the consistency of heavy cream (you most likely won’t use all of it).</li>

    <li>Mix in guanciale and divide pasta among bowls. Top with pepper and reserved cheese.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Serve while hot. Don't store leftovers in the fridge while it's still hot, or the vapor will condense and make the pasta soggy. When stored well, carbonara can last up to 4 days in the fridge but it's recommended to eat it within 24 hours since you first made it.</p>

    <h2>Recipe Websites</h2>

    <p>
    <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/">https://www.bonappetit.com/</a>Bon Appetit establishes a sleek, modernized take on cooking that manages to be simple yet approachable. I'm particularly fond of the way they integrate both serif and sans-serif fonts to create a cohesive feel.
        <br>
    <a href="https://tasty.co/">https://tasty.co/</a> Tasty is designed in a way to make recipes feel friendly to all. As such, they emphasize a variety of colors and bright imagery that combines with the rest of the necessary content.
        <br>
    <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/">https://www.epicurious.com/</a> While the layout of recipes take a similar approach to Bon Appetit, Epicurious places a greater emphasis on legibility by removing any clutter potentially caused by images. As such, they create a site that is very easy to comprehend.
    </p>

    <h2>Non-recipe Websites</h2>
    
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.coolthings.com/">https://www.coolthings.com/</a> I like the way that the site establishes rows of three with their own hierachy of information. This could be an interesting way to approach laying out the steps within my recipe.
        <br>
        <a href="https://cantwait.ideo.com/">https://cantwait.ideo.com/</a> Unsurprisingly, the design/consulting firm has an amazing website. I am particularly fond of the way they subtly incorporate color and illustrations while also retaining a high degree of information and legibility. Additionally, they use a great amount of motion design.
        <br>
        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">https://www.nytimes.com/</a> I love the way in which the site is designed to retain the original look and feel of a physical newspaper. I think it's an efficient example of condensing a high degree of information.
