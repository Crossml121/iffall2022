            <h1>Intro Questions</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>My name is Cross Lawn, I'm a junior majoring in Communication Design with a minor in Business of the Arts.</li>
             <li>Most of my experience is focused on the intersection of business and creativity (design, marketing, project management, etc). I am taking this class because, despite having minimal computer science experience, I've always wanted to learn how to work with HTML and CSS. Also the course is required for my major, but that's a boring answer.</li> 
            <li>I've fiddled around with HTML and CSS to see how different inputs affected outcomes but it was mostly just for fun. I would still classify myself as having little to no experience.</li> 
            <li>I hope to learn how to better articulate the technical aspects of HTML and CSS when working with design.</li> 
            <li>I think the most significant difference is considering various screen sizes and how designs can change while maintaining the same/similar elements.</li> 
            <li>https://a24films.com/: I think it exemplifies one of the most unique yet cohesive brand identities in the industry. I actively want to explore the site just to see what nicely designed surprises await on each page.</li>
            <li>https://mkorostoff.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/: The site is effective in communication through the way it highlights wealth disparity on a nearly incomprehensible scale. To reach the end, users must scroll through for several minutes.</li>
            <li>https://weareosm.com/: This site works well in the way that it's succeeded in conveying design through both desktop and mobile formats. It feels particularly suited for a mobile screen which I would imagine would be not as common of an emphasis as desktop</li>
